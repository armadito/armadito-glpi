Tests

> It’s overwhelmingly easy to write bad unit tests that add very little value to a project while inflating the cost of code changes astronomically.
Steve Sanderson.

Thus, and because it is not a Test-driven Development project, we intentionally don't do any unit tests.
In contrast, we use integration tests to avoir regression.
Consequently, Travis-CI has been configured in order to do all these integration tests.
